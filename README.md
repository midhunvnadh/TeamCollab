# SETUP

You may find the docker-compose and execute it for a standalone app.

the backend runs on
http://localhost:3001
and the frontend on
http://localhost:3000

# Known Issues

There are a lot of issues, I might have only worked a total of 15 hrs (max) collectively on this app. The requirements still satisfy "exactly" as written in task sheet.

# Deliverables

1. Dockerfile and docker-compose: In the repo.
2. Code: In the repo.
3. Postman collection: In the repo.
4. Deployed on Google Cloud Run for the backend and vercel for the frontend.
